Welcome to my random Runescape Toolkit! Here lies python-based tools to help you in your adventures! 

Currently, the tool(s) that are available are:

Lamp/Star Experience Calculator - Calculates how many stars/lamps are needed to reach a specific experience amount.
    - This (in its current state) is largely used to compare the experience amounts between medium pristmatic lamps
    and fallen stars when given a current experience amount and a target experience amount
